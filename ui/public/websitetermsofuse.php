                    <p>d.Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</p>
                    <p>You and Aumet agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any
                        arbitral or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that
                        the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Aumet
                        shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Aumet, Inc., Attn: Yahya Aqel, 3260

                        contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute,
                        and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent
                        electronically in accordance with this Agreement and will include (x) our name, postal

                        the applicable party, then either you or Aumet may, as appropriate and in accordance
                        with this Section, commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>

                    <p>e.Process</p>
                    <p>EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES IN WHICH EITHER PARTY SEEKS TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL
                        CLAIMS COURT OR SEEKS INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL USE
                        OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE
                        NAMES, LOGOS, TRADE SECRETS OR PATENTS, YOU AND AUMET AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE MUST BE
                        COMMENCED OR FILED BY YOU OR AUMET WITHIN (1) YEAR OF THE DATE THE DISPUTE AROSE,
                        OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND AUMET
                        WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT SUCH CLAIM REGARDING THE DISPUTE). You and Aumet
                        agree that &nbsp;(a) any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California, (b)
                        arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance
                        with&nbsp;the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
                        Related Disputes (the &ldquo;<u>AAA Rules</u>&rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified
                        by this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section, and (c) that the state or federal
                        courts of the State of California, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the
                        enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims
                        court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the
                        requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>f.Authority of Arbitrator</p>
                    <p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms of Use and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator
                        will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and
                        substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a
                        Dispute is arbitral, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
                        available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority
                        to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these
                        Terms of Use. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not
                        consolidate more than one individual&rsquo;s claims, preside over any type of class or
                        representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one
                        individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or the applicable AAA Rules,
                        discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to one set of interrogatories, one set of
                        requests for admissions, and one set of requests for production of documents.</p>
                    <p>The arbitrator&rsquo;s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the
                        &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo; section above as to the types and amounts of
                        damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                        injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to
                        provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. If you prevail in
                        arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, to
                        the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek and hereby waive all rights
                        we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if we
                        prevail in arbitration.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>g.Rules of AAA</p>
                    <p>The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;<a
                            href="https://www.adr.org/Rules"><u>https://www.adr.org/Rules</u></a>&nbsp;or by
                        calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Use, you
                        either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of AAA, or
                        (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of AAA and any claim that the rules of AAA
                        are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>h.Severability</p>
                    <p>If any term, clause or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it
                        will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and
                        provisions of this Section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set
                        forth herein are severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and will remain
                        valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>i.Opt-Out Right</p>
                    <p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE
                        YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION BY WRITING TO: AUMET, INC., RE: OPT-OUT3260
                        Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304, United States. IN&nbsp;ORDER TO BE
                        EFFECTIVE, THE OPT OUT NOTICE MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND CLEARLY INDICATE YOUR
                        INTENT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION. BY OPTING OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU ARE
                        AGREEING TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH <u>SECTION 22</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>This Agreement along with our <a href="#">PRIVACY POLICY</a>&nbsp;constitutes the entire agreement
                        between you and Aumet and supersedes any prior agreements between you and Aumet with
                        respect to the subject matter herein. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
                        provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
                        any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                        invalid, we both nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to our
                        intentions as reflected in this provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement to
                        remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
                        contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our Website,
                        App, or Platform or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or
                        cause of action arose or be forever barred.&nbsp;A party&rsquo;s failure to act with
                        respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver of the party&rsquo;s
                        right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.&nbsp;All the sections
                        intended to survive the termination of this Agreement shall survive. The section titles
                        in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
                        effect.&nbsp;Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Aumet shall be given
                        by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Aumet, Inc. at 3260
                        Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304, United States. Any notices to you shall be
